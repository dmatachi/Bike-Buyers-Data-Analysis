I  worked on a project to evaluate bike buyers in Europe, North America, and the Pacific.
After cleaning the data, I utilized pivot tables to evaluate road commuters, their age bracket, purchased bikes, Gender, and Income. This helped me to know what group of people buy bikes.

However, after utilizing pivot tables, I could visualize the data and figured out that the male gender has the highest average income per purchase. The number of bikes purchased by middle-aged customers was 400.

Also, customers that cover a distance between 0 and 1 mile purchased 200 bikes.

Finally, we can say that middle-aged customers use bikes often.
